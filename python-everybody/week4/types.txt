# types

what does type mean?

- variables, literals and constants have a "type"
- python knows the difference between an integer number and a string
- for eg "+" means "addition" if something is a number and "concatenate" if something is a string

type matters

- python knows what "type" everything is
- some operations are prohibited
- you cannot "add 1" to a string
- we can ask python what type something is by using the type() function

eg.
>>> e = 'hello there'
>>> type(e)
<type 'str'>

several types of numbers

numbers have two main types
- integers are whole: -14, 2.0, 1, 100
- floating point numbers have decimal parts: -2.5, 0.0, 98.6, 14.0

- there are other number types - variations on float and integer

type conversions

- when you put an integer and floating point in an expression the integer is implicitly converted to a float
- you can control this with the built in functions int() and float()

eg.
>>> i = 42
>>> type(i)
<type 'int'>
>>> f = float(i)
>>> print f
42.0
>>> type(f)
<type 'float'>

string conversions

- can use int() and float() to convert between strings and integers
- will get error if string does not contain numbers

user input

- we can tell python to read data from user with raw_input function
- raw_input function returns a string

converting user input

- if we want to read a number from the user, we must convert it from a string to a number using a type conversion function
- later we will deal with bad input data

eg.
inp = raw_input("Europe floop?") # enter 0 
usf = int(inp) + 1
print "US floor".usf

Europe floor? 0
US floor 1

comments in python

- anything after # is ignored

string operations

some operators apply to strings
+ implies "concatenation"
* implies "multiple concatenation"

eg.
>>> print 'abc' + '123'
abc123
>>> print 'Hi' * 5
HiHiHiHiHi

mneumonic variable names

- how we choose variables names, follow best practice
- name variables to help us remember what we intend to store
- can confuse beginning students because well named variables often sound like they must be keywords

summary

- type
- reserved words
- variables (mnemonic)
- operators
- operator precedence
- integer division
- conversion between types
- user input
