# designing a data model

how will we connect the tables together

building a data model

- drawing a picture of the data objects for our application and then figuring out how to represent the objects and their relationships
- basic rule: don't put the same string data in twice - use a relationship instead
- when there is one thing in the "real world" there should be one copy of that thing in the database

in this example we'll keep track of the price of music tracks individually

string replication is significant, calling the relationship is more efficient

for each piece of info

- is the column an object or attribute of another object?
- once we define objects, we need to define the relationships between objects

where to start?

think of what is the thing that's most essential to the application. in this case a track

Fields:
track
rating
len
count

Fields => (belongs-to) Album
Album => Groups

where does genre connect to? artist? album? 

genre belongs to track, it just does. whats in the data model determines with the application is doing.

Genre => Track
