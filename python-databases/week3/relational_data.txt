# inserting relational data

sql data:
 
insert into Artist (name) values ('Led Zepplin')
insert into Artist (name) values ('AC/DC')

2 fields, id and name. it increments the id per entry

genre:

insert into Genre (name) values ('Rock')
insert into Genre (name) values ('Metal')

Rock is 1 
Metal is 2

album: 

foreign key time

insert into Album (title,artist_id) values ('Who Made Who',2)
insert into Album (title,artist_id) values ('IV',1)

now our artist_id is a foreign key, must be placed in explicity because will be used by code

artist_id => genre

import data:

insert into Track (title, rating, len, count, album_id, genre_id) values ('Black Dog', 5, 297, 0, 2, 1)

now we have the following fields in the Track table: id, title, album_id, genre_id, len, rating, count
