# reconstructing data with join

relational power

- by removing replicated data 

the JOIN Operation

- the JOIN operation links across seveeral tables as part of a select operation
- you must tell the JOIN how to use the keys that make the connection between the tables using an ON clause

create a supertable that consists of the rows of more than one table. 

eg.
select Album.title, Artist.name from Album join Artist on Album.artist_id = Artist.id

this statement queries when the Album.artist_id = Artist.id and returns matching tracks

eg.
select Album.title, Album.artist_id, Artist.id,Artist.name from Album join Artist on Album.artist_id = Artist.id

this statement queries when Album.artist_id = Artist.id (sort by artist)

construct another supertable

eg.
select Track.title, Genre.name from Track Join Genre on Track.genre_id = Genre.id

this statement queries Track.genre_id = Genre.id (sort by genre)

eg.
select Track.title, Genre.name from Track Join Genre 

sort by genre without the on clause: searches for all combinations 

SELECT Track.title,
	Track.genre_id,
	Genre.id, Genre.name
FROM Track JOIN Genre

- joining two tables without an on clause gives all possible combinations of rows
